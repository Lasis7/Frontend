## Usage of AI

I think I only used AI once or twice, and the only usage for it was for checking how to do a very specific styling in css.
This was because I didn't know how to search info for them (since they were so specific).

## Time used on making the project

In total I believe I used around 40-50 hours on making the app in the span of a month.
